# Plot.ly-Homework---Belly-Button-Biodiversity

n this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

When opening the index.html file you will be able to select the sample and then you will find two different graphs that show the different bacteria that were found in that sample
